# TITLE: water >> your_code_here_water.py
# AUTHOR: Aidan Lowe and Chalmer Lowe
# DESCRIPTION:


# You work for a water distribution company and have a file (water.txt) with
#     data for each customer's water usage in gallons.
# Your job is to find the five customers with the highest usage.

# The file: water.txt, has multiple lines. Each line contains two elements:
#     a customer ID and a number that are separated by semicolons.
#     
#     * Find the customers with the highest usage
#     * NOTE: Some customer IDs repeat... Use only the FIRST instance of a 
#       customer record to determine that customer's usage.

# For example, given the following lines:
#    j2o31i4;562
#    ja02i3k;743
#    yw83h2o;240      < duplicate: use only the fisrt line
#    i2o3401;489
#    yw83h2o;240      < duplicate: drop this record
#    2u3hoas;108
#    i12j018;712

# the top 2 customers by usage would be: 
#    ja02i3k >>> with a usage of 743
#    i12j018 >>> with a usage of 712    


# ==============================================================
# Your code goes here:
waterUsage = {}
with open('water.txt') as fin:
    data = fin.read().replace('\n',',')[:-1].split(',')
    for pair in data:
        elements = pair.split(';')
        if elements[0] not in waterUsage:
            waterUsage[elements[0]] = elements[1]
    top = sorted(waterUsage, key=waterUsage.__getitem__,reverse=True)[0:5]
    for cust in top:
        print( cust+' uses '+str(waterUsage[cust])+' gallons.')
