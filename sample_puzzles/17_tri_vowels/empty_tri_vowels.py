# TITLE: tri_vowels >> empty_tri_vowels.py
# AUTHOR: Chalmer Lowe
# DESCRIPTION:
# Read all the values from the file words.txt.
# Each line contains a word.
# Each word has one or more vowels
# Deduplicate the words, so only a single copy remains
#     of any words that might have duplicates and count
#     all the words that have three OR more vowels.
#
# For example, if the following words were in the file:
#
# pathogen       > only 3 vowels
# preselecting   > 4 vowels
# spacefaring    > 4 vowels
# pathogen       # Duplicate and only 3 vowels
# adage          > only 3 vowels
# spacefaring    # Duplicate and 4 vowels

# Thus the total word count includes: preselecting, spacefaring
#     for a total of 2.
