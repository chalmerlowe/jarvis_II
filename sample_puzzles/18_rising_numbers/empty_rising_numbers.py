# DESCRIPTION:
# Identify and sum all the numbers in the file that have a
#     "rising numerical pattern": meaning for each digit in the
#     number, the digit is either equal to OR greater than the
#     preceding digit (in this order: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
#
# For example:
#     * 12345 > rising
#     * 11112 > rising
#     * 11229 > rising
#     * 88899 > rising
#     * 54321 > NOT rising
#     * 88799 > NOT rising
#     * 45456 > NOT rising

# Based on the numbers above, the sum would be:
#     12345 + 11112 + 11229 + 88899 = 123585
