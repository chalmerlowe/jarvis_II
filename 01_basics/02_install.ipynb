    "## What is a virtual environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual environments (also called virtualenvs) are tools used to keep projects separate, especially in terms of keeping different Python versions separate and different library versions separate. Virtualenvs prevent Python's `site packages` folder  from getting disorganized and cluttered AND prevents problems that arise when one project needs `version x.x` of a library but another project needs `version y.y` of the same library. At their core, virtualenvs are glorified directories that use scripts and metadata to organize and control the environment. You are allowed to have an unlimited number of virtualenvs. And as you will see, they are very easy to create using the various command line tools, such as conda.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When should we use a virtual environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted above, anytime you have more than one project and there is a possibility of conflicts between your libraries, it is a good time to use a virtualenv. Having said that, many programmers use virtual environments for **all but the most trivial** programming tasks. Especially for beginners, using virtualenvs early on in your learning career will build a valuable skill AND help eliminate sneaky bugs related to version discrepancies. Bugs that can be hard to diagnose.\n",
